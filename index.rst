Research Background
-------------------
I specialize in experimental particle physics and am involved in the 'KOTO experiment,' which explores the very rare decay of neutral K mesons into pion mesons and two neutrinos.

In the early universe, matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts, but in the current universe, almost only matter exists. This asymmetry between matter and antimatter is referred to as CP symmetry breaking, and our universe must incorporate mechanisms that break CP symmetry. The current theoretical framework of particle physics (the Standard Model) has been successful in explaining most aspects of the universe, but it is still insufficient in several respects, including a complete explanation of CP asymmetry.

The KOTO experiment seeks to detect the rare decay of neutral K mesons as a violation of CP symmetry, thereby searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The probability of this decay occurring is extremely low, one in 30 billion, and the theoretical uncertainty is small. Therefore, any deviation from the theoretical predictions in the measured branching ratio could be evidence of new physics.
